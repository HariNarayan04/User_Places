Welcome to the **Places App project repository!**  
This project is designed to provide a smooth and interactive experience for managing users and places, built using **React** for the frontend. It allows users to sign up, log in, view other users, and add or explore places with location details. Each place contains a **title, description, image, and address**, with the address automatically converted into geographical coordinates using the **Google Maps API**.

## Technologies Used and Relevant Skills

### Frontend
- **React**: Developed the frontend using React to build reusable components, manage state efficiently with hooks, and implement routing with React Router.  
- **CSS**: Designed and styled the user interface with responsiveness in mind for a seamless user experience.  

### API Integration
- **Google Maps API**: Integrated the Geocoding API to automatically convert addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Getting Started
